# carCleanDataSet

The data used in this report comes from the car evaluation database created by Marko Bo- hanec and Vladislav RajKovic. The data maps 6 features to a class. The 6 features are buying (vhigh, high, med, low), paint (vhigh, high, med, low), doors (2,3,4,5more), persons(2,4,more), lugboot(small, med, big), and safety (low,med,high). Each car data point is labeled in a class as ”unacc”, ”acc”, ”good”, ”vgood”. The data was used to train a machine learning model with three classification techniques: naive bayes, ID3 decision tree and random forest.
