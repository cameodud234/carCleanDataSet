# carCleanDataSet

The data used in this report comes from the car evaluation database created by Marko Bo- hanec and Vladislav RajKovic. The data maps 6 features to a class. The 6 features are buying (vhigh, high, med, low), paint (vhigh, high, med, low), doors (2,3,4,5more), persons(2,4,more), lugboot(small, med, big), and safety (low,med,high). Each car data point is labeled in a class as ”unacc”, ”acc”, ”good”, ”vgood”. The data was used to train a machine learning model with three classification techniques: naive bayes, ID3 decision tree and random forest. Results reveal that the random forest is less sensitive to an increase in training data. Also, the random forest algorithm seems to be the best performing one on this dataset when factoring in overall accuracy, and per-class accuracy obtained from the confusion matrix.
